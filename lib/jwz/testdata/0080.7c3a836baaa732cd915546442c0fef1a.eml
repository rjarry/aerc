All,

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

Martin
