[viewer]
#
# Specifies the pager to use when displaying emails. Note that some filters
# may add ANSI codes to add color to rendered emails, so you may want to use a
# pager which supports ANSI codes.
#
# Default: less -R
pager=less -R

#
# If an email offers several versions (multipart), you can configure which
# mimetype to prefer. For example, this can be used to prefer plaintext over
# html emails.
#
# Default: text/plain,text/html
alternatives=text/plain,text/html

#
# Default setting to determine whether to show full headers or only parsed
# ones in message viewer.

#
# Specifies the command to run the editor with. It will be shown in an embedded
# terminal, though it may also launch a graphical window if the environment
# supports it. Defaults to $EDITOR, or vi.
editor=

[filters]
#
# Filters allow you to pipe an email body through a shell command to render
# certain emails differently, e.g. highlighting them with ANSI escape codes.
#
# The first filter which matches the email's mimetype will be used, so order
# them from most to least specific.
#
# You can also match on non-mimetypes, by prefixing with the header to match
# against (non-case-sensitive) and a comma, e.g. subject,text will match a
# subject which contains "text". Use header,~regex to match against a regex.
subject,~^\[PATCH=@SHAREDIR@/filters/hldiff.py
