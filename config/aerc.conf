[general]
#
# Used as a default path for save operations if no other path is specified.
# ~ is expanded to the current user home dir.
#
#default-save-path=

# If set to "gpg", aerc will use system gpg binary and keystore for all crypto
# operations. If set to "internal", the internal openpgp keyring will be used.
# If set to "auto", the system gpg will be preferred unless the internal
# keyring already exists, in which case the latter will be used.
#
# Default: auto
#pgp-provider=auto

# By default, the file permissions of accounts.conf must be restrictive and
# only allow reading by the file owner (0600). Set this option to true to
# ignore this permission check. Use this with care as it may expose your

# Output log messages to specified file. A path starting with ~/ is expanded to
# the user home dir. When redirecting aerc's output to a file using > shell
# redirection, this setting is ignored and log messages are printed to stdout.
#
#log-file=

# Only log messages above the specified level to log-file. Supported levels
# are: trace, debug, info, warn and error. When redirecting aerc's output to

[ui]
#
# Describes the format for each row in a mailbox view. This is a comma
# separated list of column names with an optional align and width suffix. After
# the column name, one of the '<' (left), ':' (center) or '>' (right) alignment
# characters can be added (by default, left) followed by an optional width
# specifier. The width is either an integer representing a fixed number of
# characters, or a percentage between 1% and 99% representing a fraction of the
# terminal width. It can also be one of the '*' (auto) or '=' (fit) special
# width specifiers. Auto width columns will be equally attributed the remaining
# terminal width. Fit width columns take the width of their contents. If no

[viewer]
#
# Specifies the pager to use when displaying emails. Note that some filters
# may add ANSI codes to add color to rendered emails, so you may want to use a
# pager which supports ANSI codes.
#
# Default: less -Rc
#pager=less -Rc

#
# If an email offers several versions (multipart), you can configure which

# Whether to always show the mimetype of an email, even when it is just a single part
#
# Default: false

#
# Default: true
#parse-http-links=true

[compose]
#
# Specifies the command to run the editor with. It will be shown in an embedded
# terminal, though it may also launch a graphical window if the environment
# supports it. Defaults to $EDITOR, or vi.
#editor=

#
# When set, aerc will create and read .eml files for composing that have
# non-standard \n linebreaks. This is only relevant if the used editor does not
# support CRLF linebreaks.
#
#lf-editor=false

#
# Default header fields to display when composing a message. To display
# multiple headers in the same row, separate them with a pipe, e.g. "To|From".
#
# Default: To|From,Subject
#header-layout=To|From,Subject

#
# Edit headers into the text editor instead than separate fields.
#
# When this is true, address-book-cmd is not supported and address completion
# is left to the editor itself. Also, displaying multiple headers on the same
# line is not possible.
#
# Default: false
#edit-headers=false

#
# Specifies the command to be used to tab-complete email addresses. Any
# occurrence of "%s" in the address-book-cmd will be replaced with what the
# user has typed so far.
#
# The command must output the completions to standard output, one completion
# per line. Each line must be tab-delimited, with an email address occurring as
# the first field. Only the email address field is required. The second field,
# if present, will be treated as the contact name. Additional fields are
# ignored.
#
# This parameter can also be set per account in accounts.conf.
#address-book-cmd=

# Specifies the command to be used to select attachments. Any occurrence of
# '%s' in the file-picker-cmd will be replaced with the argument <arg>
# to :attach -m <arg>. Any occurence of '%f' will be replaced by the
# location of a temporary file, from which aerc will read the selected files.
#
# If '%f' is not present, the command must output the selected files to
# standard output, one file per line. If it is present, then aerc does not
# capture the standard output and instead reads the files from the temporary
# file which should have the same format.
#file-picker-cmd=

#
# Allow to address yourself when replying
#
# Default: true
#reply-to-self=true

# Warn before sending an email with an empty subject.
#
# Default: false
#empty-subject-warning=false

#
# Warn before sending an email that matches the specified regexp but does not
# have any attachments. Leave empty to disable this feature.
#
# Uses Go's regexp syntax, documented at https://golang.org/s/re2syntax. The
# "(?im)" flags are set by default (case-insensitive and multi-line).
#
# Example:
# no-attachment-warning=^[^>]*attach(ed|ment)
#
#no-attachment-warning=

#
# When set, aerc will generate "format=flowed" bodies with a content type of
# "text/plain; format=flowed" as described in RFC3676. This format is easier to
# handle for some mailing software, and generally just looks like ordinary
# text. To actually make use of this format's features, you'll need support in
# your editor.
#
#format-flowed=false

[multipart-converters]
#
# Converters allow to generate multipart/alternative messages by converting the
# main text/plain part into any other MIME type. Only exact MIME types are
# accepted. The commands are invoked with sh -c and are expected to output
# valid UTF-8 text.
#
# Example (obviously, this requires that you write your main text/plain body
# using the markdown syntax):
#text/html=pandoc -f markdown -t html --standalone

[filters]
#
# Filters allow you to pipe an email body through a shell command to render
# certain emails differently, e.g. highlighting them with ANSI escape codes.
#
# The commands are invoked with sh -c. The following folders are prepended to
# the system $PATH to allow referencing filters from their name only:
#
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/aerc/filters
#   ~/.local/libexec/aerc/filters
#   ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/aerc/filters
#   $PREFIX/libexec/aerc/filters
#   $PREFIX/share/aerc/filters
#   /usr/libexec/aerc/filters
#   /usr/share/aerc/filters
#
# If you want to run a program in your default $PATH which has the same name
# as a builtin filter (e.g. /usr/bin/colorize), use its absolute path.
#
# The following variables are defined in the filter command environment:
#
#   AERC_MIME_TYPE      the part MIME type/subtype
#   AERC_FORMAT         the part content type format= parameter
#   AERC_FILENAME       the attachment filename (if any)
#   AERC_SUBJECT        the message Subject header value
#   AERC_FROM           the message From header value
#
# The first filter which matches the email's mimetype will be used, so order
# them from most to least specific.
#
# You can also match on non-mimetypes, by prefixing with the header to match
# against (non-case-sensitive) and a comma, e.g. subject,text will match a
# subject which contains "text". Use header,~regex to match against a regex.
#

# This special filter is only used to post-process email headers when
# [viewer].show-headers=true
# By default, headers are piped directly into the pager.
#
.headers=colorize

[openers]
#
# Openers allow you to specify the command to use for the :open and :open-link
# actions on a per-MIME-type basis. The :open-link URL scheme is used to
# determine the MIME type as follows: x-scheme-handler/<scheme>.
#
# {} is expanded as the temporary filename to be opened. If it is not
# encountered in the command, the temporary filename will be appened to the end
# of the command.
#
# Like [filters], openers support basic shell globbing. The first opener which
# matches the part's MIME type (or URL scheme handler MIME type) will be used,
# so order them from most to least specific.
#
# Examples:
# x-scheme-handler/irc=hexchat
# x-scheme-handler/http*=firefox
# text/html=surf -dfgms
# text/plain=gvim {} +125
# message/rfc822=thunderbird

[hooks]
#
# Hooks are triggered whenever the associated event occurs.

#
# Executed when a new email arrives in the selected folder
#mail-received=notify-send "[$AERC_ACCOUNT/$AERC_FOLDER] New mail from $AERC_FROM_NAME" "$AERC_SUBJECT"

[templates]
# Templates are used to populate email bodies automatically.
#

# The directories where the templates are stored. It takes a colon-separated
